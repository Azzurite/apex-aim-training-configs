These are files used in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to help you train your aim.

# Installation

Put the files into the <CS:GO directory>/csgo/cfg directory. If you already have autoexec.cfg, then you should be able to know what to do to merge this `autoexec.cfg` and yours, so just do that.

# Usage

You can change settings in the `apex_usersettings.cfg` file. They are annotated so it should be easy to change.

Now you can enable different aim practice modes in CS:GO with the F9-F11 keys, F9 for one-shot-headshot mode, F10 for many-shots-to kill and F11 for shotgun practice mode.
